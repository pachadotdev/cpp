Description: Provides a header only, 'C++' interface to 'R' with enhancements over 'cpp11'. Enforces copy-on-write
    semantics consistent with 'R' behavior. Offers native support for ALTREP objects, 'UTF-8' string handling, modern 
    'C++11' features and idioms, and reduced memory requirements. Allows for vendoring, making it useful for restricted
    environments. Compared to 'cpp11', it adds support for converting 'C++' maps to 'R' lists, 'Roxygen' documentation
    directly in 'C++' code, proper handling of matrix attributes, support for nullable external pointers, bidirectional
    copy of complex number types, flexibility in type conversions, use of nullable pointers, and various performance
    optimizations.
