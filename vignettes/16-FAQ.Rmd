Below are some Frequently Asked Questions about cpp4r. If you have a question that you think would fit well here please [open an issue](https://github.com/pachadotdev/cpp4r/issues/new/choose).

# 1. What are the underlying types of cpp4r objects?

| vector          | element         |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| cpp4r::integers | int             |
| cpp4r::doubles  | double          |
| cpp4r::logicals | cpp4r::r_bool   |
| cpp4r::strings  | cpp4r::r_string |
| cpp4r::raws     | uint8_t         |
| cpp4r::list     | SEXP            |

# 2. How do I add elements to a list?

Use the `push_back()` method.
You will need to use `cpp4r::as_sexp()` if you want to convert arbitrary C++ objects to `SEXP` before inserting them into the list.

```cpp
#include <cpp4r.hpp>
#include <vector>

[[cpp4r::register]]
cpp4r::writable::list foo_push() {
  cpp4r::writable::list x;

  // An object that is already a `SEXP`
  x.push_back(R_NilValue);

  // A single integer
  x.push_back(cpp4r::as_sexp(1));

  // A C++ vector of ints
  std::vector<int> elt{1, 2, 3};
  x.push_back(cpp4r::as_sexp(elt));

  return x;
}
```

To create named lists, use the `push_back()` method with the named literal syntax.
The named literal syntax is defined in the `cpp4r::literals` namespace.
In this case, creating the named literal automatically calls `as_sexp()` for you.

```cpp
#include <cpp4r.hpp>

[[cpp4r::register]]
cpp4r::writable::list foo_push_named() {
  using namespace cpp4r::literals;

  cpp4r::writable::list x;
  x.push_back({"foo"_nm = 1});

  return x;
}
```

Note that if you know the size of the list ahead of time (which you often do!), then it is more efficient to state that up front.

```cpp
#include <cpp4r.hpp>
#include <vector>

[[cpp4r::register]]
cpp4r::writable::list foo_push_sized() {
  std::vector<int> elt{1, 2, 3};

  R_xlen_t size = 3;

  cpp4r::writable::list x(size);
  x[0] = R_NilValue;
  x[1] = cpp4r::as_sexp(1);
  x[2] = cpp4r::as_sexp(elt);

  return x;
}
```

# 3. Does cpp4r support default arguments?

cpp4r does not support default arguments, while convenient they would require more complexity to support than is currently worthwhile.
If you need default argument support you can use a wrapper function around your cpp4r registered function.
A common convention is to name the internal function with a trailing `_`.

```cpp
#include <cpp4r.hpp>
[[cpp4r::register]]
double add_some_(double x, double amount) {
  return x + amount;
}
```

```r
add_some <- function(x, amount = 1) {
  add_some_(x, amount)
}
add_some(1)
add_some(1, amount = 5)
```

# 4. How do I create a new empty list?

Define a new writable list object.

`cpp4r::writable::list x;`

# 5. How do I retrieve (named) elements from a named vector/list?

Use the `[]` accessor function.

`x["foo"]`

# 6. How can I tell whether a vector is named?

Use the `named()` method for vector classes.

```cpp
#include <cpp4r.hpp>

[[cpp4r::register]]
bool is_named(cpp4r::strings x) {
  return x.named();
}
```

```r
is_named("foo")

is_named(c(x = "foo"))
```

# 7. How do I return a "cpp4r::writable::logicals" object with only a "FALSE" value?

You need to use [list initialization](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/list_initialization.html) with `{}` to create the object.

```cpp
#include <cpp4r.hpp>

[[cpp4r::register]]
cpp4r::writable::logicals my_false() {
  return {FALSE};
}

[[cpp4r::register]]
cpp4r::writable::logicals my_true() {
  return {TRUE};
}

[[cpp4r::register]]
cpp4r::writable::logicals my_both() {
  return {TRUE, FALSE, TRUE};
}
```

```r
my_false()

my_true()

my_both()
```

# 8. How do I create a new empty environment?

To do this you need to call the `base::new.env()` function from C++.
This can be done by creating a `cpp4r::function` object and then calling it to generate the new environment.

```cpp
#include <cpp4r.hpp>

[[cpp4r::register]]
cpp4r::environment create_environment() {
  cpp4r::function new_env(cpp4r::package("base")["new.env"]);
  return new_env();
}
```

# 9. How do I assign and retrieve values in an environment? What happens if I try to get a value that does not exist?

Use `[]` to retrieve or assign values from an environment by name.
If a value does not exist, it will error.
To check for existence ahead of time, use the `exists()` method.

```cpp
#include <cpp4r.hpp>

[[cpp4r::register]]
bool foo_exists(cpp4r::environment x) {
  return x.exists("foo");
}

[[cpp4r::register]]
void set_foo(cpp4r::environment x, double value) {
  x["foo"] = value;
}
```

```r
x <- new.env()

foo_exists(x)

set_foo(x, 1)

foo_exists(x)
```

# 10. How can I create a "cpp4r:raws" from a "std::string"?

There is no built in way to do this.
One method would be to `push_back()` each element of the string individually.

```cpp
#include <cpp4r.hpp>

[[cpp4r::register]]
cpp4r::raws push_raws() {
  std::string x("hi");
  cpp4r::writable::raws out;

  for (auto c : x) {
    out.push_back(c);
  }

  return out;
}
```

```r
push_raws()
```

# 11. How can I create a "std::string" from a "cpp4r::writable::string"?

Because C++ does not allow for two implicit cast, explicitly cast to `cpp4r::r_string` first.

```cpp
#include <cpp4r.hpp>
#include <string>

[[cpp4r::register]]
std::string my_string() {
  cpp4r::writable::strings x({"foo", "bar"});
  std::string elt = cpp4r::r_string(x[0]);
  return elt;
}
```

# 12. What are the types for C++ iterators?

The iterators are `::iterator` classes contained inside the vector classes.
For example the iterator for `cpp4r::doubles` would be `cpp4r::doubles::iterator` and the iterator for `cpp4r::writable::doubles` would be `cpp4r::writable::doubles::iterator`.

# 13. What's wrong with "using namespace std"?

The `using namespace std` directive will not be included in the generated code of the function signatures, and it
will not be included in future releases.

Please do not use `using namespace std;`. It is considered bad practice in C++ because it can lead to name conflicts and
ambiguities, especially in larger codebases or when integrating multiple libraries.

Some interesting discussion on this topic can be found in the following links:

* [What's the problem with "using namespace std;"?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1452721/whats-the-problem-with-using-namespace-std)
* [Why "using namespace std" is considered bad practice](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpp/using-namespace-std-considered-bad-practice/)
* [Why You Should Avoid Using namespace std in C++: Best Practices for Clean and Maintainable Code](https://medium.com/@pradeepbehara/why-you-should-avoid-using-namespace-std-in-c-best-practices-for-clean-and-maintainable-code-e9ab77518be4)

Even when this will work:

```cpp
#include <cpp4r.hpp>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

[[cpp4r::register]] std::string foobar() {
  return string("foo") + "-bar";
}
```

Please please please do this instead:

```cpp
#include <cpp4r.hpp>
#include <string>

[[cpp4r::register]]
std::string foobar() {
  return std::string("foo") + "-bar";
}
```

# 14. How do I modify a vector in place?

In place modification breaks the normal semantics of R code.
In general it should be avoided, which is why `cpp4r::writable` classes always copy their data when constructed.

However, if you are *positive* in-place modification is necessary for your use case, you can use the move constructor to do this.

```cpp
#include <cpp4r.hpp>

[[cpp4r::register]]
void add_one(cpp4r::sexp x_sexp) {
  cpp4r::writable::integers x(std::move(x_sexp.data()));
  for (auto&& value : x) {
    ++value;
  }
}
```

```r
x <- c(1L, 2L, 3L, 4L)
.Internal(inspect(x))
add_one(x)
.Internal(inspect(x))
x
```

# 15. Should I call "unwind_protect" manually?

`cpp4r::unwind_protect()` is cpp4r's way of safely calling R's C API. In short, it allows you to run a function that might throw an R error, catch the `longjmp()` of that error, promote it to an exception that is thrown and caught by a try/catch that cpp4r sets up for you at `.Call()` time (which allows destructors to run), and finally tells R to continue unwinding the stack now that the C++ objects have had a chance to destruct as needed.

Since `cpp4r::unwind_protect()` takes an arbitrary function, you may be wondering if you should use it for your own custom needs.
In general, this is advised against because this is an extremely advanced feature that is prone to subtle and hard to debug issues.

## Destructors

The following setup for `test_destructor_ok()` with a manual call to `unwind_protect()` would work:

```cpp
#include <cpp4r.hpp>

class A {
 public:
  ~A();
};

A::~A() {
  Rprintf("hi from the destructor!");
}

[[cpp4r::register]]
void test_destructor_ok() {
  A a{};
  cpp4r::unwind_protect([&] {
    Rf_error("oh no!");
  });
}

[[cpp4r::register]]
void test_destructor_bad() {
  cpp4r::unwind_protect([&] {
    A a{};
    Rf_error("oh no!");
  });
}
```

```r
test_destructor_ok()
```

But if you happen to move `a` into the `unwind_protect()`, then it will not be destructed, and you will end up with a memory leak at best, and a much more sinister issue if your destructor is important:

```r
test_destructor_bad()
#> Error: oh no!
```

In general, the only code that can be called within `unwind_protect()` is "pure" C code or C++ code that only uses POD (plain-old-data) types and no exceptions.
If you mix complex C++ objects with R's C API within `unwind_protect()`, then any R errors will result in a jump that prevents your destructors from running.

## Nested `unwind_protect()`

Another issue that can arise has to do with *nested* calls to `unwind_protect()`.
It is very hard (if not impossible) to end up with invalidly nested `unwind_protect()` calls when using the typical cpp4r API, but you can manually create a scenario like the following:

```cpp
#include <cpp4r.hpp>

[[cpp4r::register]]
void test_nested() {
  cpp4r::unwind_protect([&] {
    cpp4r::unwind_protect([&] {
      Rf_error("oh no!");
    });
  });
}
```

If you were to run `test_nested()` from R, it would likely crash or hang your R session due to the following chain of events:

-   `test_nested()` sets up a try/catch to catch unwind exceptions
-   The outer `unwind_protect()` is called. It uses the C function `R_UnwindProtect()` to call its lambda function.
-   The inner `unwind_protect()` is called. It again uses `R_UnwindProtect()`, this time to call `Rf_error()`.
-   `Rf_error()` performs a `longjmp()` which is caught by the inner `unwind_protect()` and promoted to an exception.
-   That exception is thrown, but because the code is in the outer call to `R_UnwindProtect()` (a C function), it ends up throwing that exception *across* C stack frames. This is *undefined behavior*, which is known to have caused R to crash on certain platforms.

You might think that you'd never do this, but the same scenario can also occur with a combination of 1 call to `unwind_protect()` combined with usage of the cpp4r API:

```cpp
#include <cpp4r.hpp>

[[cpp4r::register]]
void test_hidden_nested() {
  cpp4r::unwind_protect([&] {
    cpp4r::stop("oh no!");
  });
}
```

Because `cpp4r::stop()` (and most of the cpp4r API) uses `unwind_protect()` internally, this has indirectly ended up in a nested `unwind_protect()` scenario again.

In general, if you must use `unwind_protect()` then you must be very careful not to use any of the cpp4r API inside of the `unwind_protect()` call.

It is worth pointing out that calling out to an R function from cpp4r which then calls back into cpp4r is still safe, i.e. if the registered version of the imaginary `test_outer()` function below was called from R, then that would work:

```cpp
#include <cpp4r.hpp>

[[cpp4r::register]]
void test_inner() {
  cpp4r::stop("oh no!")
}

[[cpp4r::register]]
void test_outer() {
  auto fn = cpp4r::package("mypackage")["test_inner"]
  fn();
}
```

This might seem unsafe because `cpp4r::package()` uses `unwind_protect()` to call the R function for `test_inner()`, which then goes back into C++ to call `cpp4r::stop()`, which itself uses `unwind_protect()`, so it seems like the code is in a nested scenario, but this scenario does actually work.
It makes more sense if you analyze it one step at a time:

-   Call the R function for `test_outer()`
-   A try/catch is set up to catch unwind exceptions
-   The C++ function for `test_outer()` is called
-   `cpp4r::package()` uses `unwind_protect()` to call the R function for `test_inner()`
-   Call the R function for `test_inner()`
-   A try/catch is set up to catch unwind exceptions (*this is the key!*)
-   The C++ function for `test_inner()` is called
-   `cpp4r::stop("oh no!")` is called, which uses `unwind_protect()` to call `Rf_error()`, causing a `longjmp()`, which is caught by that `unwind_protect()` and promoted to an exception.
-   That exception is thrown, but this time it is caught by the try/catch set up by `test_inner()` as it was entered from the R side. This prevents that exception from crossing the C++ -\> C boundary.
-   The try/catch calls `R_ContinueUnwind()`, which `longjmp()`s again, and now the `unwind_protect()` set up by `cpp4r::package()` catches that, and promotes it to an exception.
-   That exception is thrown and caught by the try/catch set up by `test_outer()`.
-   The try/catch calls `R_ContinueUnwind()`, which `longjmp()`s again, and at this point the `longjmp()` can safely proceed to force an R error.

If you have read the above bullet and still feel like you need to call `unwind_protect()`, then you should keep in mind the following when writing the function to unwind-protect:

-   You should not create any C++ objects that have destructors.
-   You should not use any parts of the cpp4r API that may call `unwind_protect()`.
-   You must be very careful not to call `unwind_protect()` in a nested manner.

In other words, if you only use plain-old-data types, are careful to never throw exceptions, and only use R's C API, then you can use `unwind_protect()`.

One place you may want to do this is when working with long character vectors.
Unfortunately, due to the way cpp4r must protect the individual CHARSXP objects that make up a character vector, it can currently be quite slow to use the cpp4r API for this.
Consider this example of extracting out individual elements with `x[i]` vs using the native R API:

```cpp
#include <cpp4r.hpp>

[[cpp4r::register]]
cpp4r::sexp test_extract_cpp4r(cpp4r::strings x) {
  const R_xlen_t size = x.size();

  for (R_xlen_t i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
    (void) x[i];
  }

  return R_NilValue;
}

[[cpp4r::register]]
cpp4r::sexp test_extract_r_api(cpp4r::strings x) {
  const R_xlen_t size = x.size();
  const SEXP data{x};

  cpp4r::unwind_protect([&] {
    for (R_xlen_t i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
      (void) STRING_ELT(data, i);
    }
  });

  return R_NilValue;
}
```

```r
set.seed(123)
x <- sample(letters, 1e6, replace = TRUE)

bench::mark(
  test_extract_cpp4r(x),
  test_extract_r_api(x)
)
```

There are plans to improve on this in the future, but for now this is one of the only places where it is felt to be reasonable to call `unwind_protect()` manually.

# 16. How do I modify a matrix rownames/colnames on C++ side?

Any of the following options will work (the commented code works with cpp4r):

```cpp
[[cpp4r::register]]
cpp4r::doubles_matrix<> copy_mat(cpp4r::doubles_matrix<> x) {
  cpp4r::writable::doubles_matrix<> out = x;

  // SEXP dimnames = x.attr("dimnames");
  // if (dimnames != R_NilValue) {
  //   Rf_setAttrib(out.data(), R_DimNamesSymbol, dimnames);
  // }

  out.attr("dimnames") = x.attr("dimnames");

  return out;
}

[[cpp4r::register]]
SEXP copy_mat_as_sexp(cpp4r::doubles_matrix<> x) {
  cpp4r::writable::doubles_matrix<> out = x;

  // SEXP dimnames = x.attr("dimnames");
  // if (dimnames != R_NilValue) {
  //   Rf_setAttrib(out.data(), R_DimNamesSymbol, dimnames);
  // }

  out.attr("dimnames") = x.attr("dimnames");

  return out;
}

[[cpp4r::register]]
cpp4r::doubles_matrix<> create_mat() {
  cpp4r::writable::doubles_matrix<> out(2, 2);

  out(0, 0) = 1;
  out(0, 1) = 2;
  out(1, 0) = 3;
  out(1, 1) = 4;

  cpp4r::writable::list dimnames(2);
  dimnames[0] = cpp4r::strings({"a", "b"});
  dimnames[1] = cpp4r::strings({"c", "d"});

  out.attr("dimnames") = dimnames;

  return out;
}

[[cpp4r::register]]
cpp4r::doubles_matrix<> create_mat_no_rownames() {
  cpp4r::writable::doubles_matrix<> out(2, 2);

  out(0, 0) = 1;
  out(0, 1) = 2;
  out(1, 0) = 3;
  out(1, 1) = 4;

  cpp4r::writable::list dimnames(2);
  dimnames[0] = R_NilValue; // No row names
  dimnames[1] = cpp4r::strings({"x1", "x2"});

  out.attr("dimnames") = dimnames;

  return out;
}
```
